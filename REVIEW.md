# Code Review

## 1. Email send button never re-enables after a send attempt
- **Location:** `index.html`, `sendEmail` handler.
- **Issue:** After initiating an EmailJS send, the code disables the send button and changes its text to “Sending…”. Neither the success nor failure callbacks ever clear `sendBtn.disabled`, so the button stays disabled for the remainder of the session. Users cannot send another email without refreshing.
- **Recommendation:** Re-enable the button in both the success and error branches (and potentially reset the label) so operators can continue sending emails or retry after a failure.

## 2. Remote seeding treats failed uploads as success
- **Location:** `index.html`, `syncThemesRemote`, `syncFontsRemote`, and `ensureRemoteSeed`.
- **Issue:** `syncThemesRemote`/`syncFontsRemote` wrap the `fetch` calls in `try/catch` but do not check `resp.ok`. On HTTP errors (403/500), the promise still resolves; `ensureRemoteSeed` then marks `kvSeeded` as true even though nothing was persisted, so subsequent loads skip seeding and the remote KV stays empty.
- **Recommendation:** Inspect the response status. If the write fails, throw or return `false` so `ensureRemoteSeed` can avoid setting `kvSeeded` and surface an error to the admin.
